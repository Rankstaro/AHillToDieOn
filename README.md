# A Hill To Die On
 A continuation of the Cabin-Prototype concept, starting from scratch.
 
## The Idea
 A co-op survival horror. Players begin inside a shack at the centre of a randomly generated island. 
 During the day players must go out and collect logs from trees, and loot from graves. These are used to help them survive the night and secure their shack.
 Graves will mainly return treasure, but sometimes you can get bullets, fuel, bandages, planks or nails. You may also incur the wrath of the dead ðŸ˜°.
 The shack is broken up into sections with multiple openings. These openings must be boarded and the section lit for the section to be considered secure. Secured sections allow for more items and treasure to be stored.
 At night, enemies become more dangerous. Make sure you have enough resources to hunker down for the night; if you're outside you will also be pursued by a terrifyingly unrelenting and unstoppable... *thing*. Enemies will begin breaking boarded openings. If they get inside, they will rip apart any stored items... ***AND YOU!***
 
 * *Bullets:* hese are used as ammunition for a slow-firing gun. You should use these sparingly.
 * *Fuel:* Used to power a generator which provides energy for the sawmill, the light in each section and electrical traps that lie beneath each window. This is a very important resource.
 * *Bandages:*  Heal the player. 
 * *Nails:*  Combined with planks, nails are used to barricade openings in the shack to keep the shack secure.
 * *Planks:*  Are created by putting logs into the sawmill. The sawmill requires energy.
 * *Treasure:*  Is used to trade with the trader, who comes every 3 days. The trader sells all of the above. Buy wisely!
